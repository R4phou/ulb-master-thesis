#Clustering-MCDA related paper:
- **Hwang, Lee, and Fabozzi** use deep *clustering techniques* to identify the characteristics of households’ finances *in a multidimensional context*.
	- The proposed approach combines a dimension reduction component and a clustering algorithm based on Gaussian mixture model. 
	- The methodology is applied to a dataset obtained from a survey on the financial soundness of Korean households and comparative results are presented against other clustering algorithms.

List of all the paper cited in this paper:
1. **Cavallo and Ishizaka**: This paper examines the scales used to express decision makers' linguistic assessments in multicriteria methods based on pairwise comparisons. The authors conduct an experimental analysis comparing eight different scales for problems of varying sizes.
    
2. **Ciardiello and Genovese**: This paper presents a comparative analysis between the TOPSIS multicriteria method and the simple additive weighting model. It focuses on decision-making problems where the number of alternatives significantly exceeds the number of criteria, considering different distance metrics for TOPSIS.
    
3. **Xu, Chang, and Liu**: The authors develop data-driven decision models for classification problems using an ensemble learning approach. Their methodology involves a two-stage optimization model for assigning weights to base classifiers, aiming to minimize ensemble error and maximize diversity.
