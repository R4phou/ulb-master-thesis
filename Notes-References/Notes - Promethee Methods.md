### GAIA PLANE

$\delta$ = quantity of information preserved

Matrix $M (n\times k)$

#gaia-plane is the plane for which as much information as possible is preserved after projection. It is a **meta model**.
- Defined with *principal component analysis* technique by the **two eigenvectors** of covariance matrix $M'M$ of the single criterion net flow
- ![](Pasted%20image%2020241001212504.png)
- $\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2},\dots,\lambda_{k}$ = set of $k$ eigenvalues of $M'M$ ranked from highest to lowest

$\implies$ Usually try to have $\delta>60\%$ and sometimes even more. **Less than 0.5 and it becomes useless.**
### Graphical display of the alternatives and criteria
- **P 1**: The longer a criterion axis in the GAIA plane, the more discriminating this criterion.
- **P 2**: Criteria expressing similar preferences are represented by axes oriented in approximatively the same direction. 
- **P 3:** Criteria expressing conflicting preferences are oriented in opposite directions. 
- **P 4**: Criteria that are not related to each others in terms of preferences are represented by orthogonal axes.
- **P 5**: Similar alternatives are represented by points located close to each other. 
- **P 6**: Alternatives being good on a particular criterion are represented by points located in the direction of the corresponding criterion axis

### PROMETHEE Decision stick
Idea is that the #gaia-plane remains the same if #weights are changed but the #decision-stick changes and leads to a different ranking
