For Entire dataset

# Nb of criteria
K = data.columns.shape[0] # Nb of criteria
L = data.iloc[0]["co2prod"].shape[0] # Length of the time series

W = [1/K for i in range(K)] # Weights of the criteria (equal weights)
Q = [4, 0.3, 40,  0.4, 4, 2] # Indifference thresholds
P = [28, 0.9, 80, 1, 20, 12] # Preference thresholds

Weight_vector = [1/L for _ in range(L)] # Equal weights times



DeuxiÃ¨me algo
- Sum of eta value is a bit assumption to study, what do we lose and what do we keep?
- We have a temporal distances so temporal clustering (cluster at every time step then look at evolution of clusters)
- Cluster l times and look at evolution of clusters
- Look at stability of clusters over time
--> then lose question of the evolution through time when clusters

==> Try time point clustering then look at the evolution of the clusters


Weighted sum to time series to scalar -> Temporal clustering
